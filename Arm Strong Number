   explanation : -
This is a simple Python program that checks if a given number is an Armstrong number. 
The program takes an input number from the user and stores it in the number variable.
Then, it initializes a result variable to keep track of the sum of the digits raised to the power of 3, and a temporary variable that is a copy of number to use in the while loop.
The while loop runs as long as temporary is greater than 0. 
On each iteration of the loop, the last digit of temporary is obtained by taking the remainder of temporary divided by 10 (temporary % 10), and stored in the digit variable. 
Then, the digit raised to the power of 3 is added to the result (result += digit ** 3). Finally, temporary is updated to remove the last digit by floor division with 10 (temporary //= 10).
After the while loop, the program checks if number is equal to result. 
If they are equal, then the number is an Armstrong number, and the program prints number followed by the message "an Armstrong number". 
If they are not equal, then the number is not an Armstrong number, and the program prints number followed by the message "not an armstrong number".
