a = int(input())
b = 1
for i in range(1, a+1):
    b = b*i
print(b)

Explanation:

The code takes an input 'a' which is an integer. Then it initializes a variable 'b' to 1.
Next, a 'for' loop is used to iterate through a range of numbers from 1 to 'a+1'.
Within each iteration, the current value of 'i' is multiplied with the current value of 'b', and the result is stored back into 'b'.
Finally, after the loop ends, the value of 'b' is printed which is the factorial of the input integer 'a'.
The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers up to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 54321 = 120.
