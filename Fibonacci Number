n = int(input())
lst = [0,1]
for i in range(2,n):
    lst.append(lst[i-1]+lst[i-2])
print(lst)

Explanation:

The given Python code generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term where n is taken as input from the user.
The code first accepts an integer input from the user and stores it in the variable n.
A list lst is created with the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence [0, 1].
A for loop is used to iterate through the range of numbers from 2 to n.
In each iteration, a new term is generated by adding the previous two terms in the sequence using the formula lst[i-1]+lst[i-2], and the new term is appended to the list lst.
Finally, the complete list lst containing the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term is printed as the output.
For example, if the user inputs 10, the output will be [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34], which is the Fibonacci sequence up to the 10th term...
