   Explanation:
   This code checks whether a given number "num" is prime or not.

It does this by counting the number of factors that "num" has, starting from 1 up to "num" itself.
If "num" has exactly two factors, namely 1 and itself, then it is a prime number, and the code prints the message "num is prime". 
Otherwise, if "num" has more than two factors or less than two factors (i.e., 1 or 0), then it is not a prime number, and the code prints the message "num is not prime".
